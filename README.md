# GP Demo
(Unshameful disclaimer!) Based on Google Sample: GitHubBrowserSample, with just some modifications to adapt it to the demo for GP.

The main functionality of this app will be:
    To show a list of users,
    and allow the creation of new users,   using the Reqres.in API.
         ( https://reqres.in/  )

     We are trying to show the usage of:
        Kotlin,
        Dependency Injection (dagger2),
        Retrofit library (square - to make REST ful api calls),
        Glide (handle images),
        Architecture Components
          using such elements as :   Navigation,
                                     Binding,
                                     Live Data,
                                     ViewModel,
                                     Room


We see this app-project as the starting point for further discussions about my android skills.


I will try to follow these path-steps during developing (modifications):

    Basic-Fundamentals:
        Readme - notes - ideas - plan
        Main Activity  / Application
        Utility / Executors classes / DI (dagger) / Binding

    Data:
        Model / Room / Db
        Remote Data source:  API / Retrofit / Web service

    Repository:

    ViewModel / Livedata

    UI:
        Activity/Fragment / RecyclerView / Add user

    TEST:
        Junit / UI - Espreso / DB / ViewModel / Webservice


we will try to commit into the github repository after each step (whenever possible).


There are going to be some pending tasks, for example: Update an user entry,  Delete an entry, but then again is just the starting point for further discussions.
